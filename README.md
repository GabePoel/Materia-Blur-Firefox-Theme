# Materia-Blur-Firefox-Theme
A Firefox theme to match dark materia blur color schemes. Currently draws heavily from [blurfox](https://github.com/manilarome/blurredfox/) and MrOtherGuy's [autohide_toolbox](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks/blob/master/chrome/autohide_toolbox.css) but with some changes to color scheme, context menu formatting, and allowing the page to appear with blur underneath the navigation bar like Safari does.

## Install Guide

Just drop the `chrome` folder into your `~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release` directory and set your `about:config` settings to match `Advanced Preference_files`. An actual install script may be made some day maybe.
